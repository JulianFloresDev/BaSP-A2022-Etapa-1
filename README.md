## _[Week 04:](https://julianfloresdev.github.io/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-04/index.html)_ CSS Flex-Box Model
This week it's time to recreate the mobile and tablet versions from latest week design, also this week we must to work whit 'flex-box' model.

### This week I

- Redesign my README.md to include GitHubPages to my work space.
- Restructured _'style.css'_ into several components, which one represents each layout sections.
- I gave _'mobile-first'_ structure to my CSS whit flex-box model & media queries.

## _[Week 05:](https://julianfloresdev.github.io/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-05/index.html)_ Javascript - Algorithms
This week it's time to learn javascript and for that I decided to do as many exercises of the 'FreeCodeCamp' platform as possible.

After that, I took care of doing the exercises of the weekly problem, but as I felt like continuing with javascript, and because I already had previous knowledge, I decided to continue with the exercises of 'FreeCodeCamp'.

### This week I
- Practice Javscript and general programming logic concepts.
- Deeply train my concepts about array methods.

## _[Week 06:](https://julianfloresdev.github.io/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-06/views/index.html)_ Javascript - DOM
This week we had the challenge of creating the user registration and login pages for the application. For this we had to put into practice what we had learned about Javascript, to perform the corresponding verifications in the fields of each form.

On the other hand we had the need to give shape and structure to the aforementioned pages, so that they look faithful to the original design in Figma, replicating and reusing as much as possible the styles created weeks ago.

### This week I
- Create the corresponding Log In & Registration pages.
- Style these pages with the components already created, and with new components if needed.
- Create the corresponding validations so that the form fields are consistent with what is requested.

## _[Week 06:](https://julianfloresdev.github.io/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-07/views/index.html)_ Javascript - Promisses & Fetch
